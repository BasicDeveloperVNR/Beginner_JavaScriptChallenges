intial comparision start with empty to first index word.
We can achieve this by three ways,
  a) Normal For Loop
  b) Sorting the array by length.
  c) reduce the given array into one value by it is length..

@Note: Sort and reduce using callback function --> which means Function as a parameter.

Step 03) Print the result of step 02 in calling function.

Programs are:
1)
